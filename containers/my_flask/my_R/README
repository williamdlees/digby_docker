To reduce dependency pain:
- Remember most R package installation failures are caused by the absence of system libraries installed by apt-get
- To monitor progress easily, use docker build --no-cache -t my_r . | tee docker.log | grep "DONE\|ERROR"
- Fix any errors immediately on sight. Explicitly install failing pacjkages at the top of the script, for fast feedback

To update the app:
- modify the code as you want
- build the app: docker build --no-cache -t my_r . 
- from Container Station press Edit, Validate YML and Apply. No need to make any changes to the YML
- to migrate, telnet into the flask container from Container station: then flask db migrate, flask db upgrade
- (can block port 80 on the router first to avoid issues)
